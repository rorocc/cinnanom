    "comment": "As you can see in the picture, this bun has been too long in the sun without suncream. Jokes aside, I had Bit buns quite some time and liked it usually, but when I came the cinnanom test, I got this really dry one. Also, it doesn’t have tons of cinnamon taste. But if you’re lucky, you can get a good bun here - the smell is all over the train and bus stations - lovely!"

I’m quoting the second tester for this bun: “It feels like chewing on raw dough with cinnamon” - wow, he must have had a sleepless night or something. Also, sweet tongues need to be strong: it has a weak taste of cinnamon and isn’t that sweet either."

The bun has a lovely optic, the perfect amount of cinnamon worked into the dough with a nice level of sweetness. Also, it has a juicy core in the center. With the price of 46 NOK definitely one of the more expensive ones, but it's worth it!"
