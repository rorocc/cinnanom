The bun has a lovely optic, the perfect amount of cinnamon worked into the dough with a nice level of sweetness. Also, it has a juicy core in the center. With the price of 46 NOK definitely one of the more expensive ones, but it's worth it!"

I’m quoting the second tester for this bun: “It feels like chewing on raw dough with cinnamon” - wow, he must have had a sleepless night or something. Also, sweet tongues need to be strong: it has a weak taste of cinnamon and isn’t that sweet either."
