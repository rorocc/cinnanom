# cinnanom

You like some really good cinnamon buns? Well, I do - and if you also do, then you should take a look at [cinnanom](https://rorocc.github.io/cinnanom)!

It is a little fun web-based project that lists some of the cinnamon buns we tested and rated in Oslo, Norway. 



## There is still some work to do
- [x] Listing cinnamon ratings from a JSON file
- [x] Showing the geolocation of the buns on an open source map
- [ ] Pagination for cinnamon bun cards
- [ ] Optimizing for mobile devices
- [ ] Interesting facts about the project
- [ ] Section explaining the rating criteria
- [ ] Fancy animations! âœ¨
  - [ ] On scroll / lazy loading
  - [ ] Logo
